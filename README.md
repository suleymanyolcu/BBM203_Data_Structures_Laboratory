## Assignment 1: High-Dimensional Matrices, Image Processing

This assignment is designed to introduce you to C++ and basic data structures, with a focus on high-dimensional matrices. The key concepts covered include:

- **Classes**: Understanding constructors and destructors.
- **Matrix Operations**: Implementing basic operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
- **Image Processing**: Applying matrix operations for basic image processing tasks.

This project provides hands-on experience with fundamental C++ concepts and melds theoretical knowledge with real-world applications.

## Assignment 2: BlockFall Game

**BlockFall** is a console-based tile-matching game inspired by the classic Tetris. This assignment focuses on dynamic memory allocation and data structures like multilevel linked lists. 

Features include:
- **Gameplay Mechanics**: Move and rotate falling blocks to create complete horizontal lines.
- **Game Modes**: Default (Tetris-like) and Gravity mode (blocks can break apart and fall).
- **Power-Ups**: Scoring mechanisms, leaderboards, and more.

This assignment emphasizes:
- **Linked Lists**: Understanding and working with multilevel linked lists.
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Using C++'s dynamic memory management.

## Assignment 3: Network Protocol Stack Simulation

In this assignment, a simplified version of a network protocol stack is implemented, similar to the Internet protocol suite. The stack consists of the following layers:

1. **Application Layer**: Communication between applications.
2. **Transport Layer**: End-to-end data delivery.
3. **Network Layer**: Packet routing.
4. **Data Link/Physical Layer**: Accessing physical media and delivering frames.

Key objectives:
- Implement communication between clients in a network.
- Simple packet routing.
- Logging and reporting network activity.

## Assignment 4: Binary Search Trees and Left-Leaning Red-Black Trees

This assignment focuses on various binary search tree (BST) operations, including:

- **Building a BST**
- **Finding and deleting nodes**
- **Shortest path and pathfinding algorithms**
- **Left-Leaning Red-Black Trees (LLRB)**: Implementing similar operations using LLRB trees, a balanced form of BST.
